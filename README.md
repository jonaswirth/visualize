# visualize
Small JS application to visualize how many calories you have burned in a defined timespan.

This is a small test project, I wanted to do a little application without using any libraries or frameworks. No jQuery, no Bootstrap, no SASS,
no TypeScript. Just plain old Html, CSS and JavaScript.
